		// Followig lines has to parts: key and text, separated by '=>'
		// Key is used to look for a text. So it has not to be changed.
		// '=>' also has to remain intact. It's used by computer.
		// Text is what is going to be actually shown in user screen. So it should be translated
		// to target language.
		// Symbols like '%s', '<br />', '<a href="*****">...</a>', '\n' should remain instact. They are going to be 
		// replaced by another text. 
		// Last too lines are also required. Computer use them to know where file ends.
		// That's all. Happy translating.
